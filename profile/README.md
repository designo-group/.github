## Designø Group ltd

We build sustainable software and engineering solutions with privacy at heart. Our unified authentication system allows users to securely access all our services with a single account. Built around passkeys and removing passwords altogether, it paves the way towards a more secure and privacy-focused online world.   

Across all our projects, we prioritize efficiency, sustainability, and privacy; building systems that reduce environmental impact while upholding the highest standards of security, usability, and trust.
